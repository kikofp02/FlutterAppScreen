# FlutterAppScreen

A **Flutter application development exercise** focused on creating an adaptive screen to display information about an anime character.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was an exercise in Flutter development where I implemented an **adaptive UI** that dynamically adjusts based on the data provided in `characters.json`. This allows easy replication and scalability.

### ✨ Features
- Dynamically loads character data from `characters.json`
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Foundation for future API integration for real-time data

## 🚀 Motivation
The goal was to establish a **foundation for a more advanced anime information app**, similar to **MyAnimeList**, by ensuring that content loading from external sources (like JSON or APIs) is straightforward.
